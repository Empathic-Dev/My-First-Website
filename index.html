		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am a 22-year-old, depressed college dropout. And this is my first website! Welcome to my little corner of the web. I'm going to be super honest about myself here.</p>
		<p>Like most people, I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up. I never had that eureka moment. I never woke up knowing exactly what I was born to do. I want to believe that I'm more than the mistake of two teenagers. I want to believe that I'm more than a burden to my parents. I mean, there are things I like to do. I like making music and art. I love writing poetry and stories. And I love sharing my creations with the world.</p>
		<p>But I don't know how to turn my hobbies into a career. And I don't know how to stop being so self-critical. I know I'm a newb and newbs need to practice practice practice. But I also have debt. And I have to help pay rent. But I can't do that until I establish myself in my career of choice. And I don't even know what my career of choice is.</p>
		<p>I went to college for Game Art & Animation. I started a career in IT. I started learning WebDev. I started making digital art. I started painting. I started making music. I started and loved all these things. But when it comes to learning how to make money off them... I fail.</p>
		<p>I could blame my depression for all my failures. That won't get me anywhere but further down the rabbit hole. And I do it anyway...</p>
		<p>But anyway... This website is a practice run. Not a personal blog or anything. something I can show people. Something I can say I completed. A stepping stool for a career. Something I can look back on and reflect.
